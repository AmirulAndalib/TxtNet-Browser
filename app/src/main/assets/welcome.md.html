    <p>With this app, you can view web pages and submit web forms without an internet connection.<br>
        To begin, enter a URL in the above address bar and press the magnifying glass icon or enter button to proceed.</p>
    <h1 id="options">Options</h1>
    <p>The options section of this app houses 2 major functions. Primarily, you can delete message history with the server once a large amount of web data has been stored. Secondly, you can choose to block incoming message notifications from the server to improve your experience with the app. We recommend that first-time users block the number that they wish to use in the app. To accomplish this, press the three dots in the top right of your screen and choose “Options.”</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: In order to Block, Unblock, or Delete Message History, Android requires that this app be registered as the default SMS app beginning with Android 4.4. To accomplish this, choose “Set Default SMS” in Options. When you are done, press the button again to revert to your previous Messaging app.</strong></p>
